## Prerequisite: Ollama

This project is privacy oriented and for such reason it uses Ollama as a backend. You need an Ollama endpoint to use this software.

Please refer to [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) to install Ollama on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dualmind.git
   cd dualmind
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```
   OLLAMA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434
   MODEL_1=llama2
   MODEL_2=mistral
   INITIAL_PROMPT="Let's discuss the future of AI. What are your thoughts on its potential impact on society?"
   ```

   Feel free to use the env.example file as a template.

   **Note:** The INITIAL_PROMPT is the first message that will be sent and it will be send on behalf of the second AI to the first AI.

## Usage

### Command-line Interface

To run DualMind in CLI mode:

```sh
./run_cli.sh
```

### Streamlit Web Interface

To run DualMind in Streamlit mode:

```sh
./run_streamlit.sh
```

Then, open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Customization

### System Prompts

You can customize the system prompts for each AI model by editing the `system_prompt_1.txt` and `system_prompt_2.txt` files in the project root.

### Styling

The appearance of the Streamlit interface can be customized by modifying the `style/custom.css` file.
